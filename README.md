Ionic platform has become one of the big names in app development in recent years. Moving from Ionic 1 to 4 in past few years, Ionic has not just gained popularity, but also improved its robustness and reliability. Today, Ionic framework is one of the easiest to make an android or iOS app with, and also Progressive web apps. ðŸš€

### So why integrate Phaser and Ionic? ðŸš€ ðŸ‘¾
While Ionic gives you the power of creating apps and PWA at lightening speed, you cannot really make games with it. Phaser, while great at game building, is not really about building a structured mobile or web-app. Hence, building a neat looking game app or PWA with Phaser requires an HTML + CSS wrapper, a void which Ionic perfects fills.

### Why Ionic 4
Ionic 4 gives superior performance over previous versions as it is based on Angular 6, superior version of Angular. The code is modular by default in Ionic 4 and , therefore, can be rearranged to modify the app as per liking. Above all, it assures nearly bug-free builds on devices.
